# Notes

Hi James,

I had some issues with my FTP client (CyberDuck) and ended up getting a little flustered at the end - trying to get everything finished.  I think I was able to get most everything in working order, but I do need a little help figuring out what I did wrong on the search page.

I look forward to your notes and getting better with PHP/this side of WordPress.
